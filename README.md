Currently, this calculator relies on Fehskens-Malewicki equations. The issue with this is that it results in the estimates of altitude and velocity being significantly higher than what one would see in field. This is due to the underestimation of drag present in these simplified equations. 
Naturally, this is an assumption based on the result of calculating for the change in velocity using the formula for impulse.

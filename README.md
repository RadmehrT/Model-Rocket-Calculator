Currently, this calculator relies on Fehskens-Malewicki equations. The issue is that this over estimates the predicted altitude by quite a lot. For rough testing it shoud be fine. 
I do plan to start calculating the values using integration for more accuract results (my primary motivation for this is because drag scales exponentially).

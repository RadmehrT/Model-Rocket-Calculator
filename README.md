Currently, this calculator relies on Fehskens-Malewicki equations. The issue is that this over estimates the predicted altitude by quite a lot. For rough testing it shoud be fine. 
I do plan to start calculating the values using integration for more accurate results. I prefer this method as it allows us to account for drag in a much more realistic manner (drag increases exponentially with speed).
